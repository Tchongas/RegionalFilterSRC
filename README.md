# RegionalFilterSRC

  

Chrome extension that adds a little feature to Speedrun.com, a (primitive) way to filter leaderboards by country!

Since the website separates the runs by pages, each having 100 runs, you can only filter the runs in your current page, you will not be able to see all runs if the game has multiple pages, Someday i wil make that work

It works by adding a big Country Filter button in all leaderboards so you can click and input the country code you want

For now its a little tool that makes somethings easier
